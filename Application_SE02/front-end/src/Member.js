                Hi, I'm Abdul Barrie, a Computer Science major currently attending San Francisco State University. 
                I used to read and write a lot as a child, then I discovered computers and video games and my life went downhill from there.
                â€¦JK! Jokes aside, I've been interested in computers ever since I was young, which was what led me to want to join the CS 
                field when I grew up. Outside of coding, I enjoy literature, writing short stories and listening to music.
